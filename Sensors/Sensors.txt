Since the calsulations of the distance is based on sound and sound varies with temp and humidity
we will use DHT22 sensors for temp and humidity

 Useful notes ans points
1. PWM pulse width modulation - Pulse of same volt as of motor is sent of different width for controlling the speed of the motor
2.
